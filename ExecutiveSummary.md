#Executive Summary

To remain efficient in our production of proprietary business software, our team imports code from external sources to streamline our development. This use of external source code presents risks due to vulnerabilities which are discovered in the code by the software community and which are documented in the National Institute of Standards and Technology Common Platform Enumeration database.

In order to alleviate risk created from the use of external code, our team is developing an automated process which will retrieve up-to-date CPE data from NIST and check this information against our code which is in use. This will allow the operation to determine acceptable risk levels and respond accordingly based on policies established in our company.
