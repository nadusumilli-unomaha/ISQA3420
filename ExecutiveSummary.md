#Executive Summary

To remain efficient in our production of proprietary business software, our team imports code from external sources to streamline our development. This use of external source code presents risks due to vulnerabilities which are discovered in the code by the software community and which are documented in the National Institute of Standards and Technology Common Platform Enumeration database.

In order to alleviate risk created from the use of external code, our team is developing an automated process which will retrieve up-to-date CPE data from NIST and check this information against our in-use code as well as packages which are anticipated to be instroduced. This will allow the company to develop policy on acceptable risk levels using risk-level values determined by NIST which are based on the exploitable vulnerabilies in the code. We can then act against this information to safeguard our operation and data against external threats and maintain compliance with industry standards.
