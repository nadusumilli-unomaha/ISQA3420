#Policy Document
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is calculated by the NIST to provide a reference point for the severity of vulnerabilities for software in their database. Our organization will compare the Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) of open source software which we incorporate into our proprietary systems with the CVSS ratings provided by the NIST. Using the NIST's definition as a guide:<br/><br/>
Vulnerabilities are "Low" severity if they have a CVSS base score of 0.0-3.9.<br/>
Vulnerabilities are "Medium" severity if they have a base CVSS score of 4.0-6.9.<br/>
Vulnerabilities are "High" severity if they have a CVSS base score of 7.0-10.0.<br/><br/>
Our organization will reject the use of any open source software receiving a High severity rating from a CVSS base score of 7.0-10.<br/><br/>
Open source software receiving a Medium rating, corresponding to a CVSS score of 4.0-6.9 must receive management approval prior to use in our systems. The developer who is requesting to incorporate this software will submit a formal Request-To-Use (RTU) document which will be considered by a management team consisting of the Development Manager, Operations Manager and Executive Sponsor of the project.<br/><br/>
Software receiving a Low rating, corresponding to a CVSS score of less than 4.0, may be used without approval.<br/><br/>
Please see your department management with any questions concerning this policy.
